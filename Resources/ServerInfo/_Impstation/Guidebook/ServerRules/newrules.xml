  # Welcome To Devilstation
  
  So, where's the all-so-important roleplay indicator that tells you how to act?
  
  Well, there isn't one. We're a roleplaying server, and that's all you need to know.
 
  [textlink="If you really care all that much, click here." link="DevilRP"]
  
  Need something? Confused? AHELP. We generally will grant whatever you ask for, so long as it helps bring a bit of comedy to the round, or if it helps you with a gimmick you're going with.
  
  # Da Rules
  
  ## Before AHELPing for a rule break, consider:
  
  - People make mistakes. 
  
  - The round is not done. 
  
  - Things can change at the blink of an eye, and you should always at the very least assume someone is trying their best. Be fair to others.
  
  ## (1). Watch your mouth.
  
  - Don't use slurs or derogatory language, fictional or not.
  
  ## (2). Keep things entertaining.
  
  - The point of playing on this server is to experience, and create, a fun and entertaining story.
  
  - Killing someone or welderbombing security for no reason is not interesting.
  
  - Making the perfect plan and killing your target as an antagonist is not interesting for anyone but you.
  
  - Your actions should make the game more interesting for EVERYONE, and if done right, that should all come back to you as an entertaining and satisfying round.
  
  ## (3). Don't take things too serious.
  
  - Space Station 14 is a game where absurd things can happen. Clowns are hired on the station for God's sake. 
  
  - Overly serious characters are not fun to roleplay around.
  
  ## (4). No erotic content.
  
  - Our server only allows players who are at least 16 years of age or older. As such, we do not want any form of erotic content here.
