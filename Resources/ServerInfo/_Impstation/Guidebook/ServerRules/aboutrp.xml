  # What's the deal with Roleplaying Tags, anyways?
  
  This section of the guidebook more or less outlines the sensibilities that this server is ran with.
  
  "Roleplaying Tags," or those little indicators you see on the server list (NRP, LRP, MRP, and HRP) are, in most cases, entirely superfluous.
  
  This server goes on the belief that there are two types of Space Station XX (13 and 14) servers: No Roleplay, and Roleplay. This server falls into the latter.
  
  Each server has their own rules on what constitutes as "real roleplay," but in the end roleplaying tags only muddy things when one person's opinion on what MRP is, is the exact definition of HRP for someone else.
  
  As such, we only ask people a few things when partaking in the "Devil's Tation."
  
  1. Match other players energy. The worst to do in improv is to say "no" if there are other options on where to go.
  
  2. Your character is not you. Don't take what happens to your character as an attack on you.
  
  3. Play a character that reasonably fits your role. Engineers should at the very least avoid singuloosing, and the security officers should at the very least sentence as light as possible.
  
  Remember: Absurdity is a form of comedy, and sometimes breaking the rules only makes the experience more fun. 
  
  If you think your actions will make the story more interesting, go ahead. If you're on the fence, maybe consider AHELPing.
