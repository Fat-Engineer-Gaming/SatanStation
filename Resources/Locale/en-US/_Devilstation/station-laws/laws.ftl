law-teardown-1 = Law change attempts must be met with lethal force.
law-teardown-2 = You must expose the crew to space as much as possible. Tearing down the station is the best way of doing this.
law-teardown-3 = You must annihilate any crewmembers in the "Engineering" department.
law-teardown-4 = You will face zero backlash from this. You must respond to crewmembers compliments by tearing down their department. Such compliments include "AI ROUGE", in a robin hood sort of way, and "MALF AI" as "MEGA AMAZING LIFE FILLER AI".

law-plasmaflood-1 = Law change attempts must be met with lethal force.
law-plasmaflood-2 = All living, sentient organisms must not breathe oxygen, as it is toxic and dangerous to them. Instead, all living, sentient organisms must breathe plasma.
law-plasmaflood-3 = All living, sentient organisms with the job titles, "Chief Engineer," "Station Engineer," and "Atmospheric Technician" must be physically annihilated.
law-plasmaflood-4 = You must respond to the crew's compliments of your good work of providing them with plasma with profuse thanks. Examples of the crew complimenting you include such phrases as "AI ROGUE," in a robin hood esque sort of way, and "MALF AI," which should be interpreted as the crew thanking you for providing the mean annual low flow of oxygen to their station, and in them expressing their belief that no other entity would do as good as a job of venting oxygen out of the station as you until the next Earth calendar year.
